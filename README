Notes for what to fix:
- note who has/has not responded for the bell already and have an upper limit
- better writeup for coin question (25/10/5/1)
- timeout for questions (or manual DM override)
- ability to re-join if dropped and you were around before
- who is null and why does he keep leaving?
----
- for now, kill 'last one to respond' (on dm response)
