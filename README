Background: I wrote this for the LAL hackathon (http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160130867395240).

Based on an early version of https://github.com/ry/node_chat 
(http://dhotson.tumblr.com/post/271733389/a-simple-chat-server-in-node-js)

Notes for what to fix for next time (at least)
- Questions in their own file (these are basically burned now)
- note who has/has not responded for the bell already and have an upper limit
- better writeup for coin question (25/10/5/1)
- timeout for questions (or manual DM override)
- ability to re-join if dropped and you were around before
- who is null and why does he keep leaving?
----
- for now, kill 'last one to respond' (on dm response)
