Background: I wrote this for the LAL hackathon (http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160130867395240).

Based on an early version of https://github.com/ry/node_chat

TODO
- Rewrite using express.js and socket.io
  x Player shows up, we get their name.
  x We have a list of player's names.
  x Admin can 'start game'
  x Players see question of current round
  - Players can answer questions
    - Get response "right or wrong"
    - questions hidden from users
  x Logic for moving to the next round manually
  - Logic for moving to the next round when # of qs solved
  - Leaderboard/updates
- provide half-decent interface (bootstrap?)
- Questions in their own file (these are basically burned now)
- Convert question to markdown
- timeout for questions (or manual DM override)
- ability to re-join if dropped and you were around before
- scoreboard
