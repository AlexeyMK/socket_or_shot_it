Background: I wrote this for the LAL hackathon (http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160130867395240).

Based on an early version of https://github.com/ry/node_chat
(http://dhotson.tumblr.com/post/271733389/a-simple-chat-server-in-node-js)


BUGS:
- names are empty (probably a cookie bug)
- admin panel next round doesn't update

TODO
- Rewrite using express.js and socket.io
  x Player shows up, we get their name.
  x We have a list of player's names.
  x Admin can 'start game'
  - Players see question of current round
  - Players can answer questions
    - Get response "right or wrong"
  - Logic for moving to the next round
  - Leaderboard/updates
- provide half-decent interface (bootstrap?)
- Questions in their own file (these are basically burned now)
- Convert question to markdown
- timeout for questions (or manual DM override)
- ability to re-join if dropped and you were around before
- scoreboard
- change name to Ballmer Peak reference (Peakathaon? Ballmer Challenge?)
----
- for now, kill 'last one to respond' (on dm response)
